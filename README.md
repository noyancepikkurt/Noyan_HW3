I have developed a dictionary app where users can search for a word and find its meanings. This app requires an internet connection, and if there is no internet connection, an alert will be displayed, and users won't be able to access the home screen. On the home screen, users can search for desired words or view the last 5 searched words. After selecting a word, users can view its meanings and synonyms, as well as listen to its pronunciation. Additionally, users can filter the meanings based on the word's parts of speech (such as noun, verb, adjective, etc.). They can also click on the synonyms of the word and view their meanings as well.

# Usage
1. Launch the app on your mobile device.
2. If there is no internet connection, an alert will be displayed, and the home screen won't be accessible.
3. On the home screen, you can either search for a desired word or view the last 5 searched words.
4. To search for a word, enter the word in the search bar and tap the search button.
5. The search results will be displayed, showing the meanings and synonyms of the searched word.
6. To listen to the pronunciation of a word, tap the audio icon next to the word.
